# Push_Swap

First project for WeThinkCode_'s algorithm branch.

We were only given the operations

SA (Swap A)
SB (Swap B)
SS (Swap both)

RA (Rotate A)
RB (Rotate B)
RR (Rotate both)

RRA (Reverse Rotate A)
RRB (Reverse Rotate B)
RRR (Reverse Rotate Both)

PA (Push from B stack to A stack)
PB (Push from A stack to B stack)

My algorithm semi-efficiently sorts the numbers, I have ~700 moves for 100 numbers and ~6.5-8.0k depending on the number sets given. On average it is 7.5k.
